In this exercise, we will be using the balance_scale.txt data set.
In this data set, each data point is classified as having the balance scale tip to the right, tip to the left, or be balanced.
The variables of the data set are 'left weight', 'left distance', 'right weight', and 'right distance'.
The class is determined by the greater of (right-distance x right-weight) and (left-distance x left-weight).
However, if these values are equal, the data point is balanced.



We are provided with a data set of Canadian schools offering French immersion programs ("Second_Language_Immersion_Schools_in_Canada.csv"),
 which contains information regarding these schools such as their names, provinces and coordinates.
Suppose we would like to determine the province in which a certain school or other place of interest is located in Canada, 
given that we have the coordinates (latitude and longitude) of this place.
